# STM32 Micro Function Generator
- A micro function generator build with a STM32 Nucleo Board.
- Support for 0-3.3V DC output as well as sin, triangle, saw-tooth, and square waves at frequencies of 100Hz – 500Hz.
- Software designed with STM32 Cube IDE using state machine program architecture, multiple internal timers, and
communication with high-precision external DAC via I²C
